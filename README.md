Packages like react-three-fiber/framer-motion do not work with remix in dev mode.

## Error Reproduction

```
1. clone this repo
2. npm install
3. npm run dev
4. Open the browser in incognito mode, otherwise there will be weird errors (seems to be an issue with react 18)
5. visit http://localhost:3000/ or http://localhost:3000/motion
6. Error occurs: Cannot initialize 'routeModules'. This normally occurs when you have server code in your client modules. 
Digging into console: Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'React' has already been declared
7. git checkout react-17 and try everything again, errors persist
```


On the other hand, running `npm run build && npm run start` works fine, but why?

Try to compare build/index.js after running `npm run build && npm run start` and after running `npm run dev`.

Both outputs seem to be the same (except a sourcemap comment in the dev output).

In this comment, https://github.com/remix-run/remix/issues/2987#issuecomment-1109989928 it is mentioned that the issue could be because of esbuild.
However, given both outputs are the same, this seems unlikely?

**Update**:
After further investigation, it seems like the issue can be pinpointed to just the @react-three/drei package? Not 100% sure but seems like it. Hard to tell because caching sometimes makes it hard to reproduce for some reason. But if you comment out the <Box> component in index.tsx, the dev build should work.

This issue renders Remix basically unusable in dev mode.
